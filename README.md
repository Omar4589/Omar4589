üî≠ I'm currently embarked on an exciting journey developing my first `React Native` app, a project that not only challenges me but also serves a meaningful purpose for my community. This app aims to bridge the gap between the residents of my city and the local city services department by providing a digital platform for submitting service requests. Given that my city lacks a digital means for such submissions‚Äîrelying solely on phone calls‚Äîthis app represents a significant step forward.

The app connects to a shared server/database/API setup, utilizing `Express` for the server and `MongoDB` for the database, all orchestrated through a `GraphQL API`. This ensures a seamless flow of information between the React Native app used by residents and a React web app, which acts as an admin portal for city services to view and manage these requests.

This project is not just a technical endeavor but a solution aimed at improving local infrastructure and community service responsiveness. I'm applying what I've learned about web development to make this app a reality. If anyone has experience with similar projects, or tips and tricks for a budding React Native developer, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate your insights!
